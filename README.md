# IS601 Midterm Advanced Calculator

## Introduction

This project presents a modular and extendable Python-based calculator for the command line, featuring core arithmetic functions and a robust history management system. Designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, it uses a plugin-based architecture that enables flexible customization. The code adheres to best practices for clean design, making use of multiple design patterns.

## Key Features

- **Arithmetic Functions**: Basic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **History Management**: Easily manage past calculations by saving, loading, and editing them with CSV and `pandas` support.
- **Command Pattern**: Each command is handled uniformly via a `Command` and `CommandHandler` system.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs track command executions and errors for easy debugging.
- **Plugin-Based Flexibility**: Plugins like `greet`, `calculator`, `menu`, and `exit` allow seamless extension.
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**: Automated testing and continuous integration streamline code validation.

## Design Patterns and Rationale

### 1. Command Pattern

The **Command Pattern** enables each action (e.g., addition, subtraction) to be represented as an object. By encapsulating each operation as a command, we achieve a modular and consistent method for adding and handling operations.

- **Why use this pattern?** It enables easy addition of new operations with minimal impact on existing code, making the calculator highly flexible.

  - [Addition Command](app/plugins/calculator/add.py)
  - [Subtraction Command](app/plugins/calculator/subtract.py)
  - [History Commands](app/plugins/calculator/history_commands.py)

### 2. Facade Pattern

The **Facade Pattern** is implemented in `history_manager.py` to provide an easier interface for complex operations like saving, loading, and modifying calculation records.

- **Why use this pattern?** This pattern streamlines interactions with the history management system by hiding complex internal operations, enhancing code simplicity.
- **Code Reference**:
  - [History Manager as Facade](app/history_manager.py)

### 3. Singleton Pattern

The **Singleton Pattern** is applied to configurations, particularly for logging, to ensure only a single instance is present throughout the application.

- **Why use this pattern?** This prevents multiple configuration instances, ensuring consistency and efficient resource usage.
- **Code Reference**:
  - [Logging Configuration](logging.conf)

### 4. Plugin Architecture

The **Plugin Architecture** is the backbone of the calculatorâ€™s flexibility, enabling commands like `greet`, `calculator`, `menu`, and `exit` to be loaded dynamically and work independently.

- **Why use this pattern?** It provides dynamic functionality that is easily customizable, allowing new features to be added without modifying core components.

  - [Greet Plugin](app/plugins/greet/__init__.py)
  - [Menu Plugin](app/plugins/menu/__init__.py)
  - [Exit Plugin](app/plugins/exit/__init__.py)


## Instructions for Use

To start the application from the command line:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Available Commands

In the REPL interface, use the following commands:

- **Calculator Functions**: 
  - `add <number1> <number2>`: Adds two values.
  - `subtract <number1> <number2>`: Subtracts the second number from the first.
  - `multiply <number1> <number2>`: Multiplies two numbers.
  - `divide <number1> <number2>`: Divides the first number by the second.
  
- **History Management**:
  - `save`: Save current calculations.
  - `load`: Retrieve and view previous calculations.
  - `clear`: Remove all records from history.
  - `delete <record_id>`: Deletes a specific entry.

- **General Commands**:
  - `greet`: Display a greeting message.
  - `menu`: Lists all available commands.
  - `exit`: Terminates the application.

## Testing Suite

A full suite of tests is included in the `tests` directory. Each function is tested to ensure stability. Run tests with `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

## CI/CD Workflow

The project uses GitHub Actions to automate testing, ensuring code quality and integrity for each push or pull request.

## Logging Setup

Logging is configured in `logging.conf`, specifying log levels like INFO, DEBUG, and ERROR. Key actions logged include:

- **Commands**: Every command executed is logged, including inputs and outputs.
- **Errors**: Captures errors to assist in debugging.
- **History Changes**: Logs modifications in calculation history for traceability.

## Dependencies

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:

- `pandas`: For history data management.
- `pytest`: For testing.

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
